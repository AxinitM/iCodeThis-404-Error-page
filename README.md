## Task

Start with this design and transform it into a functional project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
If you want to go the extra mile, expand upon it, and integrate your unique touch by adding animations and interactivity.
Prioritize creativity over pixel-perfect accuracy and showcase your developer ingenuity.
P.S. My page was inspired by Neutral Studioâ€™s 404 error page (https://neutral-studio.com/404).
